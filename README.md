This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming where a premature exit from a loop leads to undefined behavior and subsequently a `Constraint_Error` exception. The issue arises because the loop index variable (`I` in this case) isn't guaranteed to hold a valid index after an `exit` statement.  Attempting to use this variable after the loop may cause a runtime error.  The solution involves ensuring that the loop index is handled appropriately, preventing the potential for out-of-bounds array access.
